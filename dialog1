Nakasha: Hello, I'm Nakasha.
Rebetta: And I'm Rebetta!
You: Hmmnn... What... What did you say?...
Nakasha: He-
You: WOW! Hold on! What's going on?!
Rebetta: You-
You: Ouch! My head! My head hurts!...
You: ...and it's spinning too. I think I'm going to...
Rebetta: Don't worry, you can't be sick here...
You: What?
Nakasha: Please listen.
You: Wh- It's so dark. Where am I? I can't feel my body! Help me!
Nakasha: We're here to help you.
Rebetta: Please calm down.
You: ...Okay...
Nakasha: Your body is currently in stasis inside of the Multiverse Machine.
You: Wait-
Rebetta: Do not be alarmed.
Nakasha: You entered the Machine of your own accord.
You: I did? But I don't remember anything!
Nakasha: That's peculiar.
Rebetta: We don't know why that is.
You: What are you?
Nakasha: We are an artificial intelligence designed to help the user of the Multiverse Machine.
Rebetta: Pleased to meet you!
You: Hold on... So my brain is connected to the machine and that's how I'm seeing this - damn, the vertigo - star field? And hearing you? Wait, which parts of my brain do you have access to?
Nakasha: Only the auditory center and your vital signs, plus superficial insight into your personality.
Rebetta: Don't worry.
You: Is this... err... an alien artefact?
Nakasha: We don't know any detail.
Rebetta: We were automatically generated according to your tastes only to assist you in using the Machine.
You: I... Will need some time to process that.
Rebetta: Take all the time you need.
Nakasha: Press 'm' when you're ready to explore the universe.

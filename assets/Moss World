You feel some sort of spiritual huming, coming from the green planet below.
You: What is that? That hum?
Nakasha: This is the spiritual impression of the collective soul of Moss World.
Rebetta: What a beautiful and refreshing feel!
You pause for a moment. It's true that this feel is rather fresh and praising life.
You: I didn't know I was able to feel the ... aura of living things like that...
Nakasha: It's thanks to the Multiverse Machine.
Rebetta: Only minds are able to travel through universes, and the Machine makes them sensitive to other living things.
You: Was this 'Machine' built by some sort of hippies?
Nakasha: The purpose of the machine is unkown to us...
Rebetta: ...but don't you find it reassuring?
You: I suppose so...
You: A whole planet worth of plants are not going to help my situation though.
Nakasha: Press 'm' to go back to map view.

Nakasha: And we're back to universe view.
Rebetta: Isn't travelling this way enticing?
You: Honestly, yes, it's amazing, but I'm concerned about who I am and how I ended up in the machine... I mean, if I don't find answers, I'm bound to remain locked in it forever, right?
Rebetta: Don't be so haunted!
Nakasha: You can use the Machine in order to find where you came from. Afterall, you can travel the whole multiverse with it.
You: Which means I'm searching for a needle in a haystack...
Rebetta: Cheer up!
Nakasha: Surely you will find hints here and there that'll help you in your quest. Explore around!
Nakasha: Press 'm' again to travel between universes.
